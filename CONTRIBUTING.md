# Contribution Guide
protontypes welcomes all new contributors to the "awesome-sustainable-technology" list. The inclusion of different perspectives in the project is important to us, so we are looking for a diverse community to engage in constructive discussions.  

# Guideline
> _Gathering state-of-the-art open source technology preserving global energy supply and vital natural resources_

A global energy supply is a central basis for human life. The following aspects should be the focus of attention in order to ensure global scalability:

* Decentralised supply
* High availability 
* Low impact on vital natural resources such as climate, water, soil or forests
* High robustness and easy maintenance 

In order to understand the impact on different ecosystems and other natural resources, these need to be monitored and recorded. Only in this way can the impact of our actions be understood on a global scale.

## What criterias must my project meet to be considered?

* The project must comply as closely as possible with the [Guideline](#guideline).
* You need to show that others than the project main developers are using the project. 
* The project needs a unique selling proposition that distinguishes it from others. Various aspects can be taken into account: a new technical approach, high performance, high usability, support for a new development environment, etc...
* Larger parts of the project are publised under an [open source license](https://choosealicense.com/) 
* The project is still activly maintained. We consider projects as still active if a new code has been added or questions are answered and completed in the last 18 months. 
* Documentation for installation and usage need to be provided.
