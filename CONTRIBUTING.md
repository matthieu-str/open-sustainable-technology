protontypes welcomes all new contributors The inclusion of different perspectives in the project is important to us, therefore we are looking for a diverse community to conduct constructive discussions. Distribution of value causes strong emotions in many people, therefore it is even more important to always treat each other with respect and objectivity. Fair distribution is in the eyes of the beholder. The complexity of people working together varies from project to project. Therefore it must be our goal to offer different tools and methods that enable us to ensure a fair distribution for as many participants as possible. It is not intended to infantilize the user. LibreSelery is a free tool for mature people. In order to become fair, the following attributes are focused:

* Free use for the largest possible number of people worldwide
* Independence from single companies
* Easy adaptation for different project types and target groups
* Transparency as far as data protection allows
* Extensibility 
* Low transaction fees
* Crossplattform design concerning API integration, operation system, continuous integration and payment.
