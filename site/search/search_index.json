As climate change is a globally emerging challenge, protontypes is starting the unique attempt to map all open sustainable technology in one list. By spreading knowledge in this domain with open software, standards, tools, and platforms a sustainable economy can be reached in a much shorter timespan. Energy Supply \u00b6 Global energy supply is a central basis for human life. The following aspects should be the focus of attention in order to ensure global scalability: Decentralised supply High availability Low impact on vital natural resources such as climate, water, soil or forests High robustness and easy maintenance In order to understand the impact on different ecosystems and other natural resources, these need to be monitored and recorded. Only in this way can the impact of our actions be understood on a global scale. Vital Natural Resources \u00b6 All life on earth is based on the availability of limited natural resources. Ensuring quality and ensuring accessibility for all life forms is a central task for sustainable technology. Therefore, the provision, monitoring, backup and recovery of vital resources plays a central role. What criteria must my project meet to be considered? \u00b6 The project must comply as closely as possible with the Guideline . You need to show that others than the project main developers are using the project. A good indicator are issues created by external users. Your project should be structured and documented in such a way that it can be reused and extended by others. Larger parts of the project are published under an open source license .
